        <summary><strong>📌 Click here to review reasons why tool requests may be declined</strong></summary>

        #### **❗ Reject Reasons (will not be accepted)**

        - <span style="color:red"><strong>🚫 Illegal or unethical tools</strong></span>  
          Examples include brute-forcing social media accounts, DoS attack scripts, or credential-harvesting kits.

        - <span style="color:red"><strong>🚫 Abandoned or extremely outdated software</strong></span>  
          Especially if it no longer builds, creates dependency conflicts, or has no active upstream maintenance.

        - <span style="color:red"><strong>🚫 Tools depending on deprecated languages or libraries</strong></span>  
          For example, Python 2 or other retired technologies that introduce security or compatibility issues.

        - <span style="color:red"><strong>🚫 Wrapper scripts with no unique functionality</strong></span>  
          Scripts that simply call another tool with preset arguments (e.g., a front-end that just runs `nmap -sV ...`).

        - <span style="color:red"><strong>🚫 Non-portable or broken build systems</strong></span>  
          Tools tied to a specific non-Arch distribution or that cannot be cleanly built on Arch/BlackArch.

        - <span style="color:red"><strong>🚫 Duplicate functionality</strong></span>  
          Tools already covered by better-maintained or more widely-used alternatives in the repository.

        - <span style="color:red"><strong>🚫 Unnecessary anonymization helpers</strong></span>  
          Scripts such as “free VPN launcher” tools. BlackArch already includes **torctl** for legitimate anonymization.

        **Before submitting, please confirm that your requested tool does not fall into any of the categories above.**

        Before opening a package request, please consider creating and submitting a pull request using the official PKGBUILD templates available in the [BlackArch PKGBUILDs repository](https://github.com/BlackArch/blackarch-pkgbuilds).

        If not, briefly explain why you are unable to submit a PR using the PKGBUILD templates.
        
        If you are unsure how to create a consistent PKGBUILD file, you may also ask for guidance in the
        [BlackArch Matrix Space](https://matrix.to/#/%23BlackArch:matrix.org).
