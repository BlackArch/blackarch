<!-- ⚠️
DO NOT OPEN A REQUEST IF:

- It is a simple wrapper for another tool, for example, a wrapper for Nmap that merely calls the program with pre-configured keys.
- The tool is very outdated or no longer supported by its developers, which often creates dependency problems for other projects.
- The tool has a broken build, relies on complex variables, or is highly dependent on a specific GNU/Linux distribution that is not Arch Linux.
- The tool is based on Python 2, and Python 2 support has ended, leading to issues with its dependencies.
- The tool duplicates the functionality of existing tools and can be entirely replaced by a more popular and supported product.
- Utilities related to anonymization or various scripts for launching free VPNs are not necessary since we provide [torctl](https://github.com/BlackArch/torctl).
- Any tools related to illegal or unethical activities, such as brute-forcing Facebook accounts or conducting Denial of Service (DOS) attacks, will not be added.
