3. BURP COLLABORATOR

3.1. The Licensor has developed Burp Collaborator which is a component of the Software's automated and manual testing tools available in respect of the Burp Suite Enterprise Edition and Burp Suite Professional Software and the terms of this section 3 shall only apply in respect of that Software. Burp Collaborator involves the Licensee deploying a system on the public web (the "Collaborator Server") which acts as the recipient of third-system interactions that may be triggered by payloads that the Software sends to target systems enabling the detection of certain types of vulnerability. A full description of the functionality of Burp Collaborator forms part of the Documentation if it applies to the version of the Software the Licensee has downloaded.

3.2. The functionality of Burp Collaborator gives rise to issues that require careful consideration by the Licensee as fully set out in the Documentation. By utilising any features of the Software that may cause interaction with Burp Collaborator, the Licensee will be deemed to have read the relevant Documentation, fully understood the functionality and the alternative methods of utilisation of Burp Collaborator and considered the consequences of utilisation for its organisation and as a result of such consideration has decided that Burp Collaborator, in the form utilised by it, is suitable and appropriate for use by it. The Licensor considers Burp Collaborator to be efficacious in identifying vulnerabilities of the target website in connection with third-system interactions, but the Licensee must make its own evaluation before using the Collaborator Server in any of the alternative manners set out in the Documentation.

3.3. If the Licensee is permitted by the Licensor to use the Burp Collaborator server as part of a bespoke consultancy permitted under the terms of the Licence, by doing so the Licensee warrants to the Licensor that it has recommended the client to use the Burp Collaborator server in accordance with the terms of the Documentation and the client has instructed the Licensee to use the same having discussed with the Licensee the contents of the Documentation relating thereto.

3.4. The Licensee acknowledges and accepts that by utilising the Burp Collaborator server either on its own behalf or on behalf of a client pursuant to a bespoke consultancy, the Licensor could be a Sub- Processor of its client's personal data under the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679). If the Licensor does act as a Sub-Processor, it shall handle the Licensee or the Licensee's client's data in accordance with its Privacy Notice and as set out in the Documentation relating to Burp Collaborator.

4. BURP INFILTRATOR

4.1. The Licensor has developed Burp Infiltrator which is a component of the Software for instrumenting deployed applications in order to facilitate testing using the Software in respect of the Burp Suite

Enterprise Edition and Burp Suite Professional Software and the terms of this section 4 shall only apply in respect of that Software. Burp Infiltrator involves the Licensee deploying or procuring deployment of the Infiltrator component within the target system which enhances the ability of the Software to detect certain types of vulnerability. A full description of the functionality of Burp Infiltrator forms part of the Documentation if it applies to the version of the Software the Licensee has downloaded.

4.2. The functionality of Burp Infiltrator gives rise to issues that require careful consideration by the user as fully set out in the Documentation. By deploying or procuring deployment of the Infiltrator tool, the Licensee will be deemed to have read the relevant Documentation, fully understood the functionality of Burp Infiltrator and considered the consequences of utilisation for its organisation and any bespoke consultancy clients of the Licensee and, as a result of such consideration, has decided that Burp Infiltrator is suitable and appropriate for use by it and by any client of the Licensee. The Licensor considers Burp Infiltrator to be efficacious in helping to identify vulnerabilities of the target website, but the Licensee must make its own evaluation before utilising Burp Infiltrator in the manner set out in the Documentation.

4.3. If the Licensee causes its client to install Burp Infiltrator as part of a bespoke consultancy permitted under the terms of the Licence, by so doing it warrants to the Licensor that it has recommended to the client to install Burp Infiltrator on its system and has discussed with the client the contents of the Documentation relating thereto and the potential consequences of such installation.

5. EXTENSIONS

5.3.1. a Burp App; or

5.3.2. part of the Software.

5.4. When the creation of an Extension is notified to the Licensor or shared publicly and comes to the attention of the Licensor the Licensor has the option, in its sole discretion, to make the Extension a Burp App (Burp App, or BApp) after having carried out such diligence as it deems appropriate, on the Extension.

5.5. The Licensor has established the BApp Store product feature where Burp Apps are described and may be downloaded without charge for use as an Extension.

5.6. All Extensions and Burp Apps remain the property of the author but by creating such Extension, the author has granted an irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive licence free of charge to the Licensor to incorporate such Extension in the Software and to use, copy, modify and adapt it for any purpose at the Licensor's option and an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive licence to use the Extension free of charge to all third party licensees who download the Burp App from the BApp Store.

5.7. If, at the sole option of the Licensor, the Licensor incorporates an Extension into the Software a notice will be placed on the BApp Store to that effect.

5.8. The Licensor retains the right, without incurring any liability to the Licensee, to disable without notice any Burp App being used by the Licensee where the Licensor considers in its sole discretion that it is necessary to do so for operational, security or quality reasons.

7.2. The Licensee acknowledges that it has no right to have access to the Software in source code form.

7.3. The integrity of this Software is protected by technical protection measures (TPM) so that the intellectual property rights, including copyright, in the Software of the Licensor are not misappropriated. The Licensee must not attempt in any way to remove or circumvent any such TPM, nor apply or manufacture for sale or hire, import, distribute, sell or let for hire, offer or expose for sale or hire, advertise for sale or hire or have in its possession for private or commercial purposes any means the sole intended purpose of which is to facilitate the unauthorised removal or circumvention of such TPM.

7.4. The Licensor will defend Licensee against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against Licensee by a third party alleging that any Software or services infringe or misappropriate such third party's intellectual property rights (a "Third Party IPR Claim"), and will indemnify Licensee from any direct damages, finally awarded against Licensee as a result of, or for amounts paid by Licensee under a settlement approved by Licensor in writing of, a Third Party IPR Claim, provided that, in each case the Licensee:

7.4.1. promptly gives Licensor written notice of the Third Party IPR Claim;

7.4.2. gives the Licensor, at its sole option, the sole control of the defence and settlement of the Third Party IPR Claim; and

7.4.3. gives Licensor all reasonable assistance, at Licensor's expense.

If Licensor receives information about an infringement or misappropriation claim related to the Software or services, Licensor may in its discretion and at no cost to Licensee (i) modify the Software or services so that they are no longer claimed to infringe or misappropriate, (ii) obtain a license for Licensee's continued use of the Software or services in accordance with this Agreement, or (iii) terminate Licensee's subscriptions for such Software or services upon 30 days' written notice and refund Licensee any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of the terminated licence. The above defence and indemnification obligations do not apply if (1) the allegation does not state with specificity that the Software or services are the basis of the Third Party Claim; (2) a Third Party Claim arises from the use or combination of the Software or services or any part thereof with software, hardware, data, or processes not provided by Licensor, if the Software or Services or use thereof would not infringe without such combination; (3) a Third Party Claim arises from Software or services for which there is no charge or has been provided on a free trial or community licence basis; or (4) a Third Party Claim arises from the Licensee's or a third party's materials or application or Licensee's breach of this Agreement. This clause provides the Licensor's sole liability to, and the Licensee's exclusive remedy against, the Licensor for any Third Party IPR Claim.

8. LICENSOR'S WARRANTY

8.1. The Licensee acknowledges that the Software and the Burp Apps are provided "as is" and have not been developed to meet its individual requirements, and that it is therefore the Licensee's responsibility to ensure that the facilities and functions of the Software as described in the Documentation and the facilities and functions of any Burp App meet its requirements.
