This is a partial fix for mishandling of grouping when formatting
integers.  It properly computes the width in presence of grouping
characteres when the precision is larger than the number of significant
digits.
This patch is originally from https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-packages/tree/packages/glibc/trunk.
