This Demonstration License is entered into by and between you ("you" or "your") and Vector 35 LLC, a Florida limited liability company ("us", "we" or "our").


We will license a “free to use” demonstration version of Binary Ninja™, a software application (the "Demonstration Software"), to you under the mutual terms and conditions in this Demonstration License for your internal evaluation purposes only. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Demonstration License, we reserve the right to revoke or terminate the Demonstration Software and this Demonstration License any at any time in our sole discretion. By installing the Demonstration Software, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Demonstration License. If you do not agree to the terms of this Demonstration License, please do not install or attempt to use the Demonstration Software.

1. Non-Exclusive Demonstration License Grant. Under the terms of this Demonstration License, the Demonstration Software is licensed on a non-exclusive basis and is not sold. You receive no title to or ownership of the Demonstration Software itself. This License is for non- commercial purposes only. This Demonstration License grants you the rights a single user license that allows a copy of the Demonstration Software to be installed and used by you on other computers you own as a single designated person. In other words, you may install the Demonstration Software on more than one computer owned by you as long as there is only one physical computer running the Demonstration Software at any time and as long as it is only used by you. This Demonstration License does not permit any concurrent use. If other users will use the Demonstration Software on any of the computers that the application will be installed on, then you are required to obtain additional licenses for each user who plans to use the Demonstration Software. If your needs require concurrent use, please contact us for alternative licensing arrangements. If other users will use the Demonstration Software, then you are required to obtain additional licenses for each user who plans to use the Demonstration Software. All rights not expressly granted herein reserved by us.

2. Free Use Demonstration License. Subject to the terms of this Demonstration License, there is no fee for the use of the Demonstration Software. Upon revocation of the Demonstration License by us, you must obtain a paid end user license for Binary Ninja™ if you intend to continue use.

3. Termination. You may terminate this Demonstration License at any time (i) by destroying all copies of Demonstration Software and related documentation and purging same from memory devices (this is required at the termination of this Demonstration License).  Your license to the Demonstration Software automatically terminates if you fail to comply with the terms of this Demonstration License. Upon termination of this Demonstration License, all licenses granted in Section 1 will terminate and you are required to stop using the Demonstration Software and delete all copies in your possession or control. The following provisions will survive termination of this Demonstration License: (i) Sections 6 through 14; and (ii) any other provision of this Demonstration License that must survive termination to fulfill its essential purpose.

4. Modification and Upgrades. We may, from time to time replace, modify or upgrade the Demonstration Software. When accepted by you, any such replacement or modified Demonstration Software code or upgrade to the Demonstration Software will be considered part of the Demonstration Software and subject to the terms of this Demonstration License (unless this Demonstration License is superseded by a further Demonstration License accompanying such replacement or modified version of or upgrade to the Demonstration Software).

5. Restrictions. Unlike the licenses for our full versions of Binary Ninja™, you may not decompile, decrypt, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise reduce the Demonstration Software to human-readable form under this Demonstration License, or permit third parties to do the same. Further, you may not alter, duplicate, modify, rent, lease, loan, sublicense, create derivative works from, or provide others with the Demonstration Software in whole or part, or transmit or communicate any of the Demonstration Software over a network in order to share the Demonstration Software with others. These restrictions include prohibitions on the use the Demonstration Software for service bureau or time-sharing purposes or in any other way allow third parties to exploit the Demonstration Software. Time-sharing means sharing the Demonstration Software with customers or other third parties and permitting their use of the Demonstration Software. Service bureau involves your use of the Demonstration Software on behalf of third parties, instead of your own use. It is your responsibility to determine if your use of the Demonstration Software is in compliance with applicable laws.

6. Export Restrictions. You must use the Demonstration Software in accordance with export laws and this means that you may not export, ship, transmit or re-export the Demonstration Software, in whole or in part, in violation of any applicable law or regulation including but not limited to applicable export administration regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

7. Disclaimer of Warranties. The Demonstration Software is provided "as is" which means that we are providing no warranty of any kind. WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. We do not warrant that the Demonstration Software will perform without error or that it will run without interruption.

8. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL OUR LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS DEMONSTRATION LICENSE EXCEED $500. IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE LIABILITIES LIMITED BY THIS SECTION 8 APPLY: (A) TO LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENCE; (B) REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE; (C) EVEN IF WE ARE ADVISED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DAMAGES IN QUESTION AND EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE; AND (D) EVEN IF YOUR REMEDIES FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. If applicable law limits the application of the provisions of this Section 8, our liability will be limited to the maximum extent permissible.

9. Severability. To the extent permitted by law, we waive and you waive any provision of law that would render any clause of this Demonstration License invalid or otherwise unenforceable in any respect. In the event that a provision of this Demonstration License is held to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, such provision will be interpreted to fulfill its intended purpose to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and the remaining provisions of this Demonstration License will continue in full force and effect.

10. Independent Contractors. We are not your agent and you are not our agent and so neither party may bind the other in any way. The parties are independent contractors and will represent themselves in all regards as independent contractors.

11. No Waiver. Neither party will be deemed to have waived any of its rights under this Demonstration License by lapse of time or by any statement or representation other than in an explicit written waiver. No waiver of a breach of this Demonstration License will constitute a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of this Demonstration License.

12. Force Majeure. To the extent caused by force majeure, no delay, failure, or default will constitute a breach of this Demonstration License.

13. Assignment & Successors. Neither party may assign this Demonstration License or any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the other’s express written consent, except that either party may assign this Demonstration License to the surviving party in a merger of that party into another entity. Except to the extent forbidden in the previous sentence, this Demonstration License will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties.

14. Choice of Law & Jurisdiction. This Demonstration License will be governed solely by the internal laws of the State of Florida, without reference to such State’s principles of conflicts of law. The parties consent to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in or for Brevard County, Florida.
