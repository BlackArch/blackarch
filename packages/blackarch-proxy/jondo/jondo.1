.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jondo
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Jondo
is the clientsoftware for JonDonym. JonDonym (the name is derived from John Doe and Anonymous) protects your privacy on the internet and makes truely anonymous websurfing possible. It consists of the following components:
    * Mixes Anonymizing intermediaries (proxies) which multiply encrypt, mix and forward data streams of several users.
    * Mix Cascades Chains of Mixes run by various independent operators. They typically consist of three Mixes: one first Mix (IN) which receives requests from the users, one middle Mix (MIDDLE) which only forwards traffic to other Mixes, and a last Mix (OUT) which sends the real outgoing requests to internet resources.
    * InfoService A separate service which provides information about the available mixes and mix cascades, thenumber of users currently using the mix cascades, and their current workload.
    * JonDo Client program installed on the user's computer. Its primary use is to establish encrypted connections to anonymising Mix Cascades. The users are called JonDonauts (resembling the term "astronauts").
 In this form, the system protects from observation by
    * the visited web server,
    * your internet access provider (internet cafe, WLAN, AOL, T-Online, ...),
    * other eavesdroppers on the connections (ECHELON,...),
    * any data retention (by international distribution) and
    * the JonDonym service itself.
