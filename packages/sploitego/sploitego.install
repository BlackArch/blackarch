Once Sploitego has been installed, it's time to install the transforms. First,
make sure Maltego has been run for the first time and initialized (i.e. logged
in, transforms   discovered, etc.). Once initialized, shutdown Maltego and run
the following command:

    $ canari install-package sploitego
