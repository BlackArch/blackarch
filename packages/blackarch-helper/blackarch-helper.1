.TH blackarch-helper 1 "July 2025" "2.1.0" "blackarch-helper Manual"

.SH NAME
blackarch-helper \- A helper to find, inspect, and build BlackArch tools from source.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blackarch-helper
[OPTIONS] <command> [argument]
.br
.B blackarch-helper
[interactive | fzf | help]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBblackarch-helper\fR is a command-line utility designed to simplify finding and building packages from the BlackArch repository using their source files.

The first step is always to run the \fBsync\fR command, which downloads the BlackArch package database using your system's mirrorlist and creates local cache indexes for fast searching.

If run without arguments, it defaults to the interactive mode powered by \fBfzf\fR. This mode allows you to first select a category, then browse the tools within it. Tools already installed on the system are marked with a 'âœ”'.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --mirror <url>
Use a specific mirror for the 'sync' command, ignoring the system mirrorlist.
