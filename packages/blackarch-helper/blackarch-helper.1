.TH blackarch-helper 1 "July 2025" "2.0.0" "blackarch-helper Manual"

.SH NAME
blackarch-helper \- A helper to find, inspect, and build BlackArch tools from source.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blackarch-helper
<command> [argument]
.br
.B blackarch-helper
[interactive | fzf | help]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBblackarch-helper\fR is a command-line utility designed to simplify finding and building packages from the BlackArch repository using their source files (PKGBUILDs). It does \fBnot\fR install pre-compiled binaries from the repository; instead, it automates the `makepkg` process.

The first step is always to run the \fBsync\fR command, which downloads the BlackArch package database and creates local cache indexes for fast searching.

If run without arguments, it defaults to the interactive mode powered by \fBfzf\fR. This mode allows you to first select a category, then browse the tools within it. Tools already installed on the system are marked with a 'âœ”'. A preview pane shows detailed package information.

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B sync
Downloads the latest package database from an official BlackArch mirror. This is a required first step. It also generates the local cache indexes used by other commands.
.TP
.B search <keyword>
Searches for packages in the local database. This is case-insensitive. Note: The interactive menu is the recommended way to search.
.TP
.B info <package-name>
Displays detailed information about a specific package from the local database. Expects the full versioned package name (e.g., nmap-7.95).
.TP
.B install <package-name>
Clones the PKGBUILD for the specified package, resolves dependencies, and builds it from source using `makepkg`. Expects the full versioned package name. Requires superuser privileges to install the final package.
.TP
.B interactive
(Also accessible via \fBfzf\fR). Starts the interactive menu. This is the default behavior if no command is provided.
.TP
.B help
(Also accessible via \fB--help\fR or \fB-h\fR). Displays the usage message.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
To initialize the tool and download the database:
.B $ blackarch-helper sync
.TP
To start the interactive menu to browse and install tools:
.B $ blackarch-helper interactive
.TP
To build and install 'nmap' (assuming you found the versioned name):
.B $ blackarch-helper install nmap-7.95

.SH CACHE
The script uses a cache directory at \fI~/.cache/blackarch-helper\fR. If you encounter issues, you can safely remove this directory (\fBrm -rf ~/.cache/blackarch-helper\fR) and run the \fBsync\fR command again.
