# the tools list here contain packages which are broken and need to be fixed.
# 'broken' can mean at least:
#   - not able to build
#   - wrong or missing dependencies
#   - runtime error
#   - code patch needed to fix
#   - wrong / lame hard-coded paths which point to invalid dirs/files
#   - rebuild necessary due to so-libs issues
#   - etc.
#
# a few notes:
#   - don't just say 'delete this' just because of old or unmaintained tool/code
#     it can be deleted when there is really no way to fix and the tool is
#     redudant (other tools exist with same funcionality)
#   - don't hesistate to provide patches:)
#   - leave a comment after '#' if not able to fix or if the fix is WIP
#   - try to fix as much as possible
