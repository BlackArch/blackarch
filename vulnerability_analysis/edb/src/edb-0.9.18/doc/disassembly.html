<h1>Disassembly Viewer</h1>

<p>The disassembly view is broken up into two parts, the actual code view, and the analysis view.</p>
<P>The code view is fairly string forward, it currently has 3 columns. The first is the address, the second is the bytes of the code at that address, and finally the third column has the disassembly of those bytes. Future versions will have a "comment" column where additional analysis will be presented as well as user specified comments.</p>
<p>Below the disassembly is the analysis of the the code currently at the instruction pointer. Here you will see many different things such as the value of any expressions or registers used as operands, whether or not a condition jump will be taken, and in some cases a pseudo-C syntax version of a call to a known library function. It is planned to have the analysis be more predictive, and have the ability for user supplied function signatures as well.</p>
