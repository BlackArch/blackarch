<h1>Installing</h1>
<p>Basic installation is simple, you may run</p>
<pre>
$ make install
</pre>
<p>Or if you would like to specify where things should go, you probably want to use something like this</p>
<pre>
make INSTALL_ROOT=/usr/ install
</pre>
<p>
In which case the plugins will be installed in /usr/lib/edb and the binaries will be installed in /usr/bin/.
Finally, if you are doing a make install, you probably want to specify a default plugin path, this is done during the qmake process, see <a href="compiling.html">compiling</a>.
