<p>The data dump tab is a general hex decimal data viewer. It is very similar to the <a href="stack.html">stack view</a></p>
<p>If you need to look at more than one region at a time, You may create new tabs by clicking the blue plus sign in the upper left corner. The new tab will be a duplicate of the currently active one. Likewise, the orange x in the upper right will remove the currently active tab.</p>
<p>There are many useful options in the context menu, such as the ability the change "word size" (here word size is defined as the number of bytes displayed as a single value). And similarly, how many words per line.
