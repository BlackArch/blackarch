## On-Boarding for new Developers

Following information are immediately needed when you want to join the BlackArch

sent to that list.

- **Handle**: For references in any BlackArch project and also for IRC/Discord.

- **Twitter**: Your twitter name if present. @blackarchlinux will then follow
you.

- **Github**: Your github Account name with 2-fa enabled. You will get full
read-write access to all repositories.

build-system.

are given and everything is setup. Anything else can be discussed on IRC.
